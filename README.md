# ComfyUI ImageMagick

**ComfyUI ImageMagick** is an extension implements custom nodes that integrated [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/index.php) into ComfyUI.

[ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/index.php) is an extremely powerful image processing tool, and you can even think of it as a command-line version of "Photoshop". This Custom Nodes plugin allows you to integrate ImageMagick into your ComfyUI workflow.

## Installation

First, install [ImageMagick 7.x](https://imagemagick.org/script/download.php) on your local and ensure that you can run the 'magick' command in the command line. 

Then, just like installing other ComfyUI plugins, run 'git clone' in the custom_nodes directory.

## How to use
This plugin implements a custom node `ImageMagick`. 

In the command line, theoretically, you can add unlimited image inputs and parameters. 

In the current version of this plugin, the node allows up to 3 image inputs and 6 parameters. 

If you find this number insufficient, please open an issue to inform me.

## Why did I think of doing this?
Initially, it was because I generated black and white line art in stable diffusion, and then I wanted to turn the line art into transparent backgrounds. Of course, I could do this in Photoshop, but isn't there a faster way? That's when I discovered ImageMagick.

With just two commands in ImageMagick, you can achieve this:
- `magick input.png -threshold 70% -negate mask.png`
- `magick input.png mask.png -alpha off -compose CopyOpacity -composite output.png`

By adjusting the `threshold`, you can control the intensity of the line art.

Then, I thought, why not directly generate transparent line art in ComfyUI? That led to the idea of integrating ImageMagick into ComfyUI.

## Examples
Here, I provide two workflows, mainly to implement the above two commands in ComfyUI:
1. [workflows1.xml](workflows/example-workflow1.json) ![overall](docs/overall.png)
2. [workflows2.xml](workflows/example-workflow2.json) ![overall](docs/example2.png)

And output:

It must be said that ImageMagick can achieve more powerful functionalities, and for specific usage, please refer to the ImageMagick official [documentation](https://imagemagick.org/script/magick.php).
